# Using MatText

## Creating text representations for crystal structures

Converting structures into text representations can be done using our [`TextRep`](api.md#mattext.representations.TextRep) class

```python
from mattext.representations import TextRep
from pymatgen.core import Structure


# Load structure from a CIF file
from_file = "InCuS2_p1.cif"
structure = Structure.from_file(from_file, "cif")

# Initialize TextRep Class
text_rep = TextRep.from_input(structure)
```

### `get_requested_text_reps` method

The [`get_requested_text_reps`](api.md#mattext.representations.TextRep.get_requested_text_reps) method retrieves the requested text representations of the crystal structure and returns them in a dictionary.

For example, to obtain the `cif_p1`, `slice`, `atoms_params`, `crystal_llm_rep`, and `zmatrix` representations, use the following code:

```python
text_rep = TextRep(structure)

# Define a list of requested representations
requested_reps = [
    "cif_p1",
    "slice",
    "atoms_params",
    "crystal_llm_rep",
    "zmatrix"
]

# Get the requested text representations
requested_text_reps = text_rep.get_requested_text_reps(requested_reps)
```

### Supported text representations

The [`TextRep`](api.md#mattext.representations.TextRep class currently supports the following text representations:

- **SlICES** (`slice`): SLICE representation of the crystal structure.
- **Composition** (`composition`): Chemical composition in hill format.
- **CIF Symmetrized** (`cif_symmetrized`): Multi-line CIF representation with symmetrized structure and rounded float numbers.
- **CIF $P_1$** (`cif_p1`): Multi-line CIF representation with the conventional unit cell and rounded float numbers.
- **Crystal-text-LLM Representation** (`crystal_llm_rep`): Representation following the format specified in the cited work.
- **Robocrystallographer Representation** (`robocrys_rep`): Representation generated by Robocrystallographer.
- **Atom Sequences** (`atoms`): List of atoms inside the unit cell.
- **Atoms Squences++** (`atoms_params`): List of atoms with lattice parameters.
- **Z-Matrix** (`zmatrix`): Z-Matrix representation of the crystal structure.
- **Local Env** (`local_env`):  List of Wyckoff label and SMILES separated by line breaks for each local environment.

For more details on each representation and how to obtain them, refer to the respective method documentation in the `TextRep` class.
